  <h1>Sustainable Practices in Agriculture</h1>
  <p>At Agri Tech, we are committed to advancing sustainable farming methods that are both economically viable and environmentally friendly. Our approach integrates several key practices aimed at conserving resources, enhancing soil fertility, and promoting biodiversity.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Key Sustainable Farming Practices</h2>
    <p>Learn about the core practices that define sustainable agriculture and how they contribute to a healthier planet.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crop Rotation: Diversifying what is planted in fields to improve soil health and reduce pest cycles.</li>
      <li>Conservation Tillage: Reducing soil erosion and water loss by minimizing tillage or adopting no-till farming.</li>
      <li>Cover Cropping: Using cover crops to prevent soil erosion, enhance soil quality, and manage weeds and pests.</li>
      <li>Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Employing a combination of biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to manage pests in an environmentally and economically sound manner.</li>
      <li>Agroforestry Practices: Integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural landscapes to enhance biodiversity and reduce erosion.</li>
      <li>Water Management: Implementing efficient irrigation practices to conserve water and reduce runoff.</li>
