    <h2>The Creator</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Mary Wangechi Kimaru, the founder of Agri Tech. My journey into the world of sustainable agriculture began during my time at Kirinyaga University, where I witnessed firsthand the impacts of conventional farming on our environment. </p>
  
    <p>In my quest, I've explored everything from traditional farming methods to cutting-edge technologies, always with sustainability in mind. Agri Tech is more than a website; it's a platform for change, designed to inspire and educate those who share our vision of a sustainable agricultural landscape enriched by technology.</p>
  
    <p>When I'm not researching the latest in sustainable farming or advocating for environmental stewardship, I enjoy Coding. I believe that understanding our connection to the land and to the food we eat is crucial in making meaningful changes in the world.</p>
  
    <p>Thank you for joining us at Agri Tech. Together, we can make a difference.</p>
